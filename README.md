# Blip â€“ Decentralized Social Media App

Blip is a decentralized social media application that empowers users with enhanced data ownership, security, and transparency. Built with React Native and Expo for the frontend, and Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity for the backend, Blip ensures that users have full control over their content. Media files are stored using IPFS, providing a censorship-resistant and tamper-proof experience.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity**: Users authenticate via Ethereum wallets, ensuring secure and private access.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Core functionalities like posting and user interactions are managed through Ethereum smart contracts.
- **IPFS Media Storage**: All media content is stored on IPFS, ensuring decentralized and reliable access.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Developed with React Native and Expo, Blip runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
